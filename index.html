        <div class="text">
                My family and I are from El Salvador, officially known as the Republic of El Salvador. It is a small yet vibrant country located 
                in Central America. It is the smallest and most densely populated nation in the region, sharing borders with Honduras to the 
                northeast, Guatemala to the northwest, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Despite its relatively compact size, El Salvador is rich 
                in history, culture, and natural beauty, making it a fascinating destination.

                including a devastating civil war that lasted from 1980 to 1992, but has since made significant progress towards stability and peace.
